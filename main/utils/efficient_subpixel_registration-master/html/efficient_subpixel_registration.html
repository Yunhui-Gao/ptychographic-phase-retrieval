         <h1>Efficient subpixel image registration by cross-correlation.</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>Registers two images (2-D rigid translation) within a  fraction of a pixel specified by the user. Instead of computing a zero-padded
               FFT (fast Fourier transform), this code uses selective upsampling by a matrix-multiply DFT (discrete FT) to dramatically reduce
               computation time and memory without sacrificing accuracy. With this procedure all the image points are used to compute the
               upsampled cross-correlation in a very small neighborhood around its peak. This algorithm is referred to as the single-step
               DFT algorithm in [1].
